            <h3>Freelancer | Web Developer</h3>
            <p>Looking for a web developer? I know there are many web developers out there. Some of them know thousand
                of languages and technology. Some of them have 20 years of experience. Choosing them will definitely be
                the
                right choice. But <b>if you are looking for someone who is dedicated to what he does, I will be perfect
                    for you</b>. I also know a little bit of everything. I can do any work if you asks me to do. But I
                started
                my journey to make something that everyone will see, feel and love. And I want to keep this up till the
                end.</p>

            <h2>Dream Big</h2>
            <h3>Not just a web developer</h3>
            <p>Nowadays people have multiple devices. It's very confusing to have a different user interface for
                different devices. I want to dedicate myself to <strong>a user-friendly and responsive frontend for all
                    devices</strong>. So that user doesn't actually feel that he switched his device. And I'm ready to
                learn any new
                language and technology for this.</p>
