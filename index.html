            <h3>Freelancer | Web Developer</h3>
            <p>Looking for a web developer? I know there are many web developers out there. Some of them know thousand
                of languages and technology. Some of them have 20 years of experience. Choosing them will definitely be
                the
                right choice. But <b>if you are looking for someone who is dedicated to what he does, I will be perfect
                    for you</b>. I also know a little bit of everything. I can do any work if you asks me to do. But I
                started
                my journey to make something that everyone will see, feel and love. And I want to keep this up till the
                end.</p>

            <h3>Not just a web developer</h3>
            <p>Nowadays people have multiple devices. It's very confusing to have a different user interface for
                different devices. I want to dedicate myself to <strong>a user-friendly and responsive frontend for all
                    devices</strong>. So that user doesn't actually feel that he switched his device. And I'm ready to
                learn any new
                language and technology for this.</p>

                <p>I love learning new things. Especially new technologies and programming languages Mongo DB, Express,
                    React Js, Node Js. That's why I've learned MERN Stack. I am now a master of HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. I
                    know everything needed to make a website functional and efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I
                    went
                    beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know the deployment, server, and
                    security. I'm looking to get hired as a front-end developer or full-stack developer.</p>

                <h3>2019-2020 | Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
                <p>I selected freelancing as my career. I started developing entire websites myself for my clients at
                    Fiverr
                    with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScipt, PHP, and MySQL. I used Laravel in all of my projects. Within
                    one
                    year created a team to provide better service to my clients. These two years were the years of
                    experience. I had to learn many new things.</p>

                <h3>2015-2019 | Wordpress Developer</h3>
                <p>At that time, WordPress was very popular for Blogs and E-commerce. I self-learned HTML, CSS for
                    customizing themes. After a year, I also learned a little bit of PHP for debugging purposes. I
                    started
                    developing custom plugins and themes for my clients. I used to make only e-commerce websites at that
                    time.</p>
