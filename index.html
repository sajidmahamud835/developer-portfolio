                        thousand
                        of languages and technologies. Some of them have 20 years of experience. Choosing them will
                        definitely
                        be

                        till

                    <h3>Not just a web developer</h3>
                    <p>Nowadays people have multiple devices. It's very confusing to have a different user interface for
                        different devices. I want to dedicate myself to <strong>a user-friendly and responsive frontend
                            for
                            all
                            devices</strong>. So that user doesn't actually feel that he switched his device. And I'm
                        ready
                        to
                        learn any new
                        language and technology for this.</p>

                        <p>I love learning new things. Especially new technologies and programming languages Mongo DB,

                        <p>I'd selected freelancing as my career. I started developing entire websites myself for my
                            clients
                            at
                            Fiverr
                            with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScipt, PHP, and MySQL. I used Laravel in all of my projects.
                            Within
                            one
                            year created a team to provide better service to my clients. These two years were the years
                            of
                            experience. I had to learn many new things.</p>

                        <p>At that time, WordPress was very popular for Blogs and E-commerce. I self-learned HTML, CSS
                            for
                            customizing themes. After a year, I also learned a little bit of PHP for debugging purposes.
                            I
                            started
                            developing custom plugins and themes for my clients. I used to make only e-commerce websites
