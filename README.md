A professional, high-performance Single Page Application (SPA) built with **vanilla technologies**. This project demonstrates mastery of core web fundamentals by implementing complex routing, physics-based animations, and responsive interactions without any external frameworks.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

This project follows a **Zero-Dependency** philosophy, proving that modern, dynamic web applications can be built without the overhead of heavy frameworks like React or Angular.

### 🧩 Core Components
- **Custom Router**: A lightweight client-side router using the generic History API to manage navigation states without page reloads.
- **Physics Engine**: Custom `wormhole.css` and JavaScript logic simulating a black hole accretion disk with gravitational distortion effects.
- **Scroll Navigation**: A unique gesture-based navigation system that triggers "wormhole travel" when users scroll past page boundaries.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies used
| Category | Technology | Usage |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **Core** | HTML5, CSS3, ES6+ JS | Semantic structure, styling, and application logic. |
| **Animation** | CSS Keyframes, JS Observers | High-performance 60fps animations and scroll-triggered reveals. |
| **Physics** | CSS Transforms, Conic Gradients | Simulating the black hole visual effects (`wormhole.css`). |
| **Integrations**| Calendly, Formspree | Embedded iframe scheduling and serverless form handling. |

## ✨ Visual Features
- **Wormhole Transitions**: A dramatic, full-screen transition effect simulating interstellar travel when changing routes.
- **Glassmorphism**: Modern UI aesthetic with frosted glass backgrounds and subtle gradients.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Pill-shaped animated buttons with shimmer effects and physics-based interactions.
- **Mobile First**: Fully responsive design with a dedicated bottom navigation bar for mobile users.

## 🚀 Usage
