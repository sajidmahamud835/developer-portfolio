### About This Gig

Stunning **mobile app designs** in Figma. User-centric research, wireframing, and high-fidelity prototyping.

Design is not just about looks; it's about how it works. I focus on creating intuitive user experiences.

#### My Process:
1.  **Discovery**: Understanding your users and goals.
2.  **Wireframing**: creating the skeletal structure.
3.  **UI Design**: Adding colors, typography, and assets.
4.  **Prototyping**: Making it interactive.

**Deliverables**: Source Figma file, assets, and style guide.
