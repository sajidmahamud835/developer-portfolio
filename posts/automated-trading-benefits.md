## The Emotional Trader vs. The Machine

The biggest enemy of a trader is not the market—it's **psychology**. Fear and greed lead to bad decisions, checking charts at 3 AM, and revenge trading.

### Enter Algorithmic Trading

An **Expert Advisor (EA)** for MT4/MT5 is a script that trades for you. It follows your rules exactly, 24/5.

**Advantages:**
1.  **Speed:** Machines react to price changes in milliseconds.
2.  **Consistency:** It takes every valid trade and skips every invalid one.
3.  **Backtesting:** You can verify if your strategy *actually* works on past data before risking real money.

### Can Any Strategy be Automated?

Almost. If you can write down your rules clearly (e.g., "Buy when RSI < 30 and Price > MA200"), it can be valued into code.
