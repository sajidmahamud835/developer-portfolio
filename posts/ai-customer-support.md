## AI is Transforming Support

Customer expectations are higher than ever. They want instant answers, 24/7. Hiring a round-the-clock support team is expensive, but an **AI Agent** works tirelessly for a fraction of the cost.

### What is RAG?

Simply connecting ChatGPT to your site isn't enough; it might hallucinate. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** solves this.
1.  We index your knowledge base (PDFs, docs, website).
2.  When a user asks a question, the AI "searches" your docs first.
3.  It then answers the user *using only your trusted data*.

### Key Benefits

1.  **Instant Response:** Zero wait times increase customer satisfaction (CSAT).
2.  **Cost Reduction:** Handle thousands of concurrent chats without extra staff.
3.  **Consistency:** The AI never has a bad day or gives incorrect info (if trained well).

### Getting Started

You don't need to be a tech giant to use this. With the OpenAI API and a vector database, we can build a custom assistant for your business in days.
