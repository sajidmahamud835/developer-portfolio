## Code is Law

A **Smart Contract** is simply a program stored on a blockchain that runs when predetermined conditions are met. They automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary's involvement or time loss.

### Real-World Use Cases

*   **DeFi (Decentralized Finance):** Automate lending, borrowing, and trading without a bank.
*   **NFTs:** Prove ownership of digital art or real-world assets.
*   **Supply Chain:** Automatically release payment when a shipment arrives at a GPS location.

### Why Solidity?

Solidity is the primary language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. It allows developers to create secure, immutable logic.

> **Security Warning:** Smart contracts are immutable. Once deployed, bugs cannot be fixed easily. That's why professional auditing and writing (like my service) is essential.
