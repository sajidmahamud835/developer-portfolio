## The Battle of Cross-Platform Frameworks

For startups, speed to market is everything. Building separate native apps for iOS and Android is expensive and time-consuming. This is where **Flutter** (by Google) and **React Native** (by Meta) shine. But which one should you choose?

### React Native: The JavaScript Giant

If your team already knows JavaScript or React, React Native is the natural choice. It uses native components, giving your app a truly native look and feel.

*   **Pros:** Huge ecosystem, hot reloading, easy over-the-air updates.
*   **Cons:** Performance can lag with complex animations compared to native or Flutter.

### Flutter: The Performance Beast

Flutter uses the Dart language and draws its own widgets. This ensures pixel-perfect consistency across all devices and blazing-fast performance (60/120 FPS).

*   **Pros:** Amazing performance, consistent UI, "Widget" system is powerful.
*   **Cons:** Dart is a niche language, slightly larger app size.

### Verdict for 2025

*   Choose **React Native** if you rely heavily on native OS features or have a strong JS team.
*   Choose **Flutter** if you need expressive, complex UIs and top-tier performance on a budget.
